        <h1>Rust - first impressions</h1>
        <p>When I wrote the <a href="parser-combinators.html">parser combinators entry</a>, I thought about doing this year's <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>(AoC)
in C++. The plan was then to show how parser combinators might look in C++. That may still come later, but for now I have started looking into Rust
instead. After a failed attempt at learning Rust several years ago, I thought using it for AoC would push me to actually pick up the language this time around.
My day job is in embedded/microcontrollers and I have been looking for a better language than C.</p>
<p>The first time I tried using Rust, the borrow checker really got in my way. Whether it is me that has changed or the compiler error messages that have
improved, this time it was a non-issue. Granted, there is not much state that is kept over time when solving small puzzles, so there was little need
to deal with lifetimes, and the occasional cloning was of little consequence performance-wise.</p>
<p>Using Rust almost feels like using Python. Due to the type inferencing, there is little need for explicit types except in function declarations. The standard
library is rich, and there are 3rd party crates like itertools that provide functionality on par with Python. Parallell processing can be as simple as using
the rayon crate, which provides parallell iterators.</p>
<p>The best thing about using Rust, though, was that during the 25 days of AoC, I did not experience a single segfault. The only crashes were due to some indexing
errors, which could have been avoided by using iterators.</p>
