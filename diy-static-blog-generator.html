        <h1>Yet another static blog generator</h1>
        <p>This is my second attempt at starting a blog. Last time, well over 10 years ago, I think I used Blogger.com,
or maybe it was a self hosted WordPress instance? Nowadays, static site generators seem to be the preferred option,
but which one to choose? I played around a bit with popular choices Hugo and Pelican.</p>
<p>For documenting one of my other projects, I want to be able to run external programs to generate images and diagrams as part of
building the site. This seems to be impossible with Hugo, where running external programs is deemed a security risk.
Pelican has plugin support that would solve the problem, though. In the end, there was just too much flexibility for my tastes, and I decided to roll my own.</p>
<p>Using Python, geting something up and running was quick enough. It supports Markdown and uses Jinja2 templates. Syntax highligthing 
is also supported. Python example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span>
<span class="normal">2</span>
<span class="normal">3</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="hll">    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#This line is highlighted</span>
</span>    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;world!)</span>
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>Content is king, after all, so this will have to be good enough for now. For the curious, 
the source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/knutel/strange">GitHub</a>.</p>
